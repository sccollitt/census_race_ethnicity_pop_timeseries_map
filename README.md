# Race and ethnicity US Census interactive timeseries chart and map app (1790 - 2020)
This is a repository for all data files and scripts, including a generalized US states map with modified polygon boxes for small Northeast states.

The resulting app includes data visualizations of historical and contemporary state and national-level US race and ethnicity population statistics (population, marginal change in population, percentage of total population, and marginal change in percentage of total population) derived from US census population data, spanning the period 1790-2020.  
The interactive data visualizations include a timeseries chart, map, and bar chart that corresponds with the map.  
Users can select among racial/ethnic groups for which data is available, decennial census years, and population statistics.
